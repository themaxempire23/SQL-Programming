# SQL-Programming
Just brushing up on my SQL fundamentals
**Project**: Developing a University Database from scrach
**Applications used; 1. **Draw.io** - for drawing the diagrams
                     2. **SQL Server Management Studio 2018 version**, to **empliment** and **create** the **database**.
**Description**;  A local university keeps records of their students to track their progress at the institution. The name, 
student number, sponsorship number, physical address and phone, postal address, date of birth, gender, 
study mode (full time, part time, distance), faculty (Computing and Informatics, Engineering and Built 
Environment, Commerce and Human Sciences) and degree programme (Bachelor, Honours, masters, PhD)
are recorded. The system used in the finance department requires the studentsâ€™ physical address to clearly 
specify the erf number, location, street and city name. The students are uniquely identified by their 
student number and the sponsorship number. Each faculty is described by a name, faculty code, office
phone, office location and phone. The faculty name and code have unique values for each faculty. Each 
course has a course name, description, course code, number of hours per semester, and level at which it 
is offered. Courses have unique course codes. A grade report has a student name, programme, letter 
grade and a grade (1,2,3,4). A faculty offers many courses to many students who are registered for a 
specific programme. A student can enrol for many courses in a semester but he or she receives only one 
grade report


**PROJECT ROAD MAP;**
1. I will create an **ERD**, that captures all the information about the university database. Which is very cruicial interms of using it our blueprint.
2.  Convert the ERD created @ (1) to a Relational Data Model clearly showing the resultant relations at each NF, by mainly creating Entity tables and connecting them   with their respective realtionships.
3. Create a **physical representation schema** for the **logical model** in (2), which guide me in _emplementing_ **SQL statements** for the database
